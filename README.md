## The Ultralight Backpacker's Guide to AI ü•æüó∫Ô∏è

Embark on an AI adventure with 'The Ultralight Backpackers Guide to AI' GitHub repository.  Each example walks through a gear list (set of plugins) and a plan to achieve a travel goal.

## Getting Started

You'll need to have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed on your computer with .NET 7. Then, you'll need to install a special extension that lets you run Jupyter notebooks within VS Code. Lastly, you can explore AI driven weather forecasting to your heart's content by stepping through the [Weather Forecast notebook](./WeatherForecast/notebook.ipynb) after you've installed your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key.

### Step 1: Set up your environment for running .C# notebooks

1. [Install .NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
2. [Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. Launch VS Code and [install the "Polyglot" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode). 

### Step 2: Get a tomorrow.io API Key

Go to [tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/) and register as a developer.

### Step 3: Install your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key

Go to the [`1-start-here` notebook](1-start-here/notebook-for-setting-up.ipynb) to set your credentials so that Semantic Kernel knows how to access your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key.

### Step 4: Now go ahead and run any of the C# notebooks
